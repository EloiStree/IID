# IID Index Integer Date

Documentation of what is a IID  Index Integer Date. (A concept I created and is the base of my software(s) )


An IID is a value store on 16 bytes when received and 12 when sent.

It is design to allows remote control on shared server and to create IMMO.

(An IMMO is a integer massive multipy player)

**Index**
Index is the user on the server.
If negatif, the user is a guest
Else it is a registered user with a claimed index

Claim means that he is recogniazed by the server and validated as owner of the index in your shared server.

**Integer**
Integer is the value you want to share between your devices. 
It can be a simple action like:
- 42 = Turn on the light
- 0 = Shutdown all my computers
- -1 = Shutdown all my light
- ...

Or in a game:
- 123456789 Join the game share on the server
- 987654321 Confirm that you want to join the game shared on the server
- 0199887766 can be a use to remote control a drone 1 in the game 
- 1800000003 The user want to fire,  1800000099 user want to autodestroy

The idea here is to create library based on sharing integer of 4 bytes.
Note that the integer is under little endian format.

**Date**

The date is a ulong in micro seconds

It max value is 18446744073709551615

The two first digit are the type and the rest is the date in mlliseconds
- 18 446744073709551615
  - 18 is the type
  - 253373149600000000 is year 9999
  - 400000000000000000 is the max value before having bugs
 
By default of this convention;
- 00 Means unkown date (developper did not or forget to specify)
  - If the next are 00, you can kind of guess:
    - 400000000000000000 
    - 000000001720342174 Seconds (
    - 000001720342174000 Milli seconds
    - 001720342174000000 Micro Seconds
  - 01: When sent in NTP date
  - 02: When to execute as NTP date
  - 03: When sent in local datetime utc
  - 04: When to execute in local datetime utc
  - 05-08: Undefined
  - 09: You don't need date you want bytes space extension
  - 
 If ou are able to use NTP in your code, try to use it.





**Conlusion**

All that to say.

I will take the time to write down some documentation in here.
But in all my software. That what is a IID.

Kind regards,
Eloi

Want to help me work on the the API around IID.

Feel free to send me donation, hire me as teacher or play my "Integer games" and "IMMO"
